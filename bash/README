This directory contains common configuration scripts that are not host-specific.
These scripts are NOT sourced automatically. Rather, the contents of global/ and
local/ directories are sourced. The former is shared across all hosts, is checked
in the repository, and consists of symbolic links. The latter is specific to each
particular host, is NOT checked in the repository, and consists of a mix of scripts
and symbolic links.

Prefix consists of three digits:

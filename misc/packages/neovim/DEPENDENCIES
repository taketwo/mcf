# tree-sitter-cli is necessary for installing tree-sitter parsers
# Mason can handle installation of this tool, however it tends to download
# a pre-compiled binary which is incompatible with Ubuntu 20.04
# Since we still need to support Ubuntu 20.04, we explicitly install the
# tool from source using cargo. Note that a corresponding symlink needs
# to be created.

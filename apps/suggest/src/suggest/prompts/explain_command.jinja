{# Command explanation prompt template - continues conversation #}
Please explain the command I just generated, breaking it down in a hierarchical structure.

Structure:
- Group components by their command (e.g., all parts of "du -ah ~/Downloads" together)
- For each command, provide:
  - The base command name (e.g., "du")
  - A description of what the command does
  - An array of parts (flags and arguments) that belong to this command
- For each part:
  - The component (flag or argument)
  - A description of what it does

Rules:
1. Commands are separated by pipes in the original command
2. Break down each flag individually, even if combined (e.g., "-rh" becomes "-r" and "-h" as separate parts)
3. Only group a flag with its argument if the flag requires the argument (e.g., "-n 5" or "-name '*.py'")
4. Keep each description concise - one or two sentences maximum
5. Do not explain pipe operators themselves

Example for "du -ah ~/Downloads | sort -rh | head -n 5":
[
  {
    "command": "du",
    "description": "Estimates file space usage",
    "parts": [
      {"component": "-a", "description": "Shows sizes for all files"},
      {"component": "-h", "description": "Human-readable format"},
      {"component": "~/Downloads", "description": "Target directory"}
    ]
  },
  {
    "command": "sort",
    "description": "Sorts the input lines",
    "parts": [
      {"component": "-r", "description": "Reverse order"},
      {"component": "-h", "description": "Sort human-readable numbers"}
    ]
  },
  {
    "command": "head",
    "description": "Outputs the first part of input",
    "parts": [
      {"component": "-n 5", "description": "Limits to first 5 lines"}
    ]
  }
]
